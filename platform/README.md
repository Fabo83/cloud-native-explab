# Cloud-native Experience Lab (for Platform Engineers)

This experience lab puts its focus on cloud-native platform engineers. No matter which implementation language is used, the conceptual items are very similar. In this lab we explore several opinionated platforms, from a bare metal CloudKoffer, to custom tailor-made Kubernetes, to provider managed Kubernetes and Cloud vendor platform solutions.

- [EKS based Kubernetes Platform](aws-kubernetes.md)
- [AWS Managed Services Platform](aws-native.md)
- [Bare Metal Kubernetes Cloudkoffer](cloudkoffer.md)
- [GKE based Kubernetes Platform](gcp-kubernetes.md)
- [GCP Managed Services Platform](gcp-native.md)
- [GiantSwarm based Kubernetes Platform](giantswarm.md)
